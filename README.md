## INTRODUCTION

This project focuses on building a platform for an organization where the alumni, present students and faculties can connect with each other. Using this web application the users can see latest announcements on jobs, events of the organization and find nearby alumni. This platform will help to simplify and encourage alumni engagement activities, thereby leveraging the power of alumni relationships. Through these regular interactions colleges are able to keep track of their alumniâ€™s progress, and identify those they can reach out for placements and webinars. An engaged alumni network allows the University to benefit from the skills and experience of the graduates by offering support to the students, to the institution and to each other.


## OBJECTIVES
1.Establishing a strong link between present students, faculties and alumni to improve the overall quality of the institution.
2.Building a knowledge sharing platform in the form of a blog where users can post blogs regarding academics, cultural and placement activities.
3.To make an interactive web application live i.e. hosting on an online server by making it   accessible to any user on any platform.
